## Bots

The objective of this repo is to build automated python bots that will pull data from a variety of sources and send text messages and notifications to users who request it. 

## Front End
The front end will be a place for where users can provide their phone number and save to Firebase. There may be a login process here to see whether the user has logged in or not. 

## Back End
The back end will be listening for API calls from Front End on when to send notifications to database of users that provided their phone number. The back end will run the notifications at scheduled intervals.
